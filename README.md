# statrethinking2_notes

This repo is a set of Rmd files that I intend to capture my notes from the Statistical Rethinking book.   In addition to the notes, I am working on building an entire workflow based on best practises from papers and ideas from Statitical rethinking.  I am also evaluating rethinking, brms and rstan packages for this task.

A little later, I plan to have tensorflow based code for each of those currently in R.
